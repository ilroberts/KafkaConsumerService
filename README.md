# KafkaConsumerService
A microservice template for developing kakfa based microservices

## Basic Principles

The fundamental concept is based on Vaughn Vernon's Scala Days talk 
[Implementing Microservices with Scala and Akka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19rbbQ46LB4&t=2320s) which uses a Domain Driven Design
to define a bounded context for each microservice

## Architectural Decision Records
The latest version of the [thoughtworks tech radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) 
has an interesting piece about [architectural decision records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record).
Whilst it is unlikely that there will be any major architectural decisions made as part of this project
the process will be used on a trial basis.
